# Anticipatory Design Philosophy Implementation

## Core Principles
1. **Predict Before Request**: Interface anticipates user needs before they're expressed
2. **Asymmetric Intelligence**: Off-center layouts create visual tension and guide attention
3. **Monochromatic Sophistication**: Black/white contrast with surgical magenta accents
4. **Conversational Surfaces**: White areas as active dialogue spaces

## Color Psychology
- **Anticipatory Black (#000000)**: Creates dramatic foundation, focuses attention
- **Conversational White (#FFFFFF)**: Active dialogue surfaces, breathing room
- **Predictive Magenta (#FF0099)**: Breakthrough moments, surgical precision only
- **Intelligent Grays**: Layered information hierarchy

## Typography System
- **Raleway Ultra-Thin (200)**: Dramatic headlines that command attention
- **Manrope Conversational (300)**: Natural dialogue text
- **Manrope Predictive (600)**: Emphasis for critical insights

## Implementation Standards
Every component must demonstrate anticipatory intelligence through:
1. Predictive suggestions that appear contextually
2. Asymmetric positioning that creates visual balance
3. White surfaces that invite interaction
4. Minimal magenta accents for breakthrough moments only
